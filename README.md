# telnet-video-player

A telnet server that plays monochrome videos

# jau tu yus

Run `convert.js` with Node.js

```sh
node convert.js <video path> <width>x<height> <framerate>
```

This will output a "video.dat" file, make sure to put that file in the telnet-video-player dir and then run `index.js` (with root priviliges cause port 23!!)

# MONOCHROME???????

this thing was made with bad apple and bad apple only in mind :p

# this is not a telnet server

i know but "telnet server" is fancier than "video player that sends everything in raw tcp", also its literally the same thing right?? /j
